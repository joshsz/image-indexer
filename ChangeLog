Added bold to accesskey available items

Added rudimentary caption system. create a text file 'captions.txt' in the dir
with the appropriate pictures. Its format is 'filename some description all on
one line'. For example:

Pic103.jpg Here I am with a huge fish!
Pic104.jpg You can use<br>html in here, <b>It's not sanitized!</b>
